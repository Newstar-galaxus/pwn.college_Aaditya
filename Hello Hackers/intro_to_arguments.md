## What I learned
Executing a command with arguments, which is what we call additional data passed to the command. 
When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. 
The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.
echo is a simple command that "echoes" all of its arguments back out onto the terminal
