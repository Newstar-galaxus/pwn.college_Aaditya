# Challenge Name
To execute the /challenge/run program from another given path

## My solve
Output:
`hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/doc directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/share/doc
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/usr/share/doc$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sCnLkzmplnNfPEVETvpNtxdy9e0.QX3QTN0wSO5gjNzEzW}`
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sCnLkzmplnNfPEVETvpNtxdy9e0.QX3QTN0wSO5gjNzEzW}`

I changed the directory to /usr/share/doc and then used the challenge run command
```

## What I learned
Same as pondering_thy_self.md, just changing directory to a new location this time
