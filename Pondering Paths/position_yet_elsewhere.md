# Challenge Name
To execute the /challenge/run program from yet another given path

## My solve
Output:
`hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kDJNRfZO1FM0HZpLdevUjNegSLG.QX4QTN0wSO5gjNzEzW}`
