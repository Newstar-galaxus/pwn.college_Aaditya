type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for bash.
```
I typed the absolute path to the run challenge program
```

## What I learned
/challenge/run is an absolute path
Challenges in pwn.college are in the challenge directory and the challenge directory is, in turn, right in the root directory (/). 
The path to the challenge directory is, thus, /challenge. 
The name of the challenge program in this level is run, and it lives in the /challenge directory.
